# Car Simulation in Simulink and Matlab

Early version of car simulation with track in Matlab.

Car parameters are found in Initialization.m. Use "sim nonlinearCarModel" to simulate in simulink.

Implemented:
* Nonlinear Dynamic Model of the Car.
* Good track following.
* Re_50 Motor Model
* Re_65 Motor Model

Todo:
Add velocity controller.
