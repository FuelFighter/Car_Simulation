# Car Simulation in Simulink and Matlab

Early version of car simulation with track in Matlab.

Car parameters are found in Initialization.m, this file will also run the simulink model.


Implemented:
* Nonlinear Dynamic Model of the Car.
* Good track following.
* Re_50 Motor Model

Todo:
* Add controllers, PID or LQR.
* Optimization
