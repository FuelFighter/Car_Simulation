# Car Simulation in Simulink and Matlab

Early version of car simulation with track in Matlab.

Car parameters are found in Initialization.m, this file will also run the simulink model.


Implemented:
* Simple Dynamic Model of the Car.
* Very Simple, not very good track following.

Todo:
* Smooth out track data, too noisy right now.
* Add controllers, PID, LQR, Optimization of track.. Everything basicly.
