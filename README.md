# Car Simulation in Simulink and Matlab

Early version of car simulation with track in Matlab.

Car parameters are found in Initialization.m, this file will also run the simulink model.


Implemented:
* Simple Dynamic Model of the Car.
* OK track following.

Todo:
* Add controllers, PID or LQR.
* Motor Models
* Optimization
